Here are some handy tips on how to eliminate some of that waiting time. <br><br> Don't shut your laptop all the way off between meetings; just put it in the low-battery consumption \"Standby\" mode. Shutting it down and waiting for it to reboot at the next meeting wastes valuable time. This way you are ready to start as soon as you arrive. <br><br> Having too many programs in your computer's Start Up folder really slows things down. The solution? Eliminate all unnecessary programs. <br><br> Stop too many programs from running at the same time when you start up the computer. Don't know how? It's easy if you follow these instructions: click the Start menu, choose Run, then type \"msconfig\" to launch the System Configuration Utility. Next, on the \"General\" tab, click \"Selective Startup.\" Then go to the \"Startup\" tab and uncheck any startup items that aren't necessary. <br><br> These are small but simple changes that you can make for yourself to save precious time.

      "question":"<b>Yummy Restaurant Guide Book Angers</b><br><br> The sale of \"Yummy Restaurant Guide Book\" is being protested by residents as well as by town council members of Carlton, Oregon. The reason for the protests is that in this year's edition, the \"Yummy Restaurant Guide Book\" criticizes a local restaurant. According to the latest edition of the guide book, the 100-year-old Magic Tree now rates zero stars in the guide book's ranking system. The book noted Magic Tree's antiquated oven, gas cooker, and what is called \"overall dull food\". Council member Morgan Lowell has called for booksellers throughout the U.S. to cancel their orders for the book. The review is a marked departure from two years ago, when Magic Tree was praised for \"still having the character and charm one expects from a country diner\". <br><br> \"Tourism is the most important industry along the coast,\" said Mayor McMurtry. \"A country restaurant is a quiet alternative to the anonymity of large restaurants, but the Yummy Restaurant Guide Book editors seem to prefer the chain restaurants in the big cities.\" Mayor McMurtry believes that the reviewers were \"unnecessarily\" critical. The Magic Tree is the town's most important landmark. Reviews like this can really hurt the local economy. Representatives for the publisher did not return calls requesting comment. \"Yummy Restaurant Guide Book\" has been in print for over 40 years.",

      "question":"<b>Employee of the Month Award</b><br><br> The Fullerton Branch School District gives an Employee of the Month award to one exceptional employee who has demonstrated innovative and outstanding work. Each year, administrative assistants compile information from each staff member's peer reviews and management evaluations. Division managers then recommend the most noteworthy employees to service managers who review the candidates and make the final decision. <br><br> his month's recipient is Donald Peterson, a crossing guard of Buffalo Creek Elementary School. Mr. Peterson has been the crossing guard at our busy intersection since the school opened in 1997. During that time, he has only missed one day of work and that was due to a knee injury. Come rain, shine, or thunderstorms, we all can rest easy knowing Mr. Peterson is keeping our students safe. He takes his job and the safety of our students very seriously. <br><br> Mr. Peterson likes to come to school early. Every day at 6 a.m., he can be found making sure the coffee is ready for our teachers, staff and parent volunteers. Every afternoon, he asks what he can do to lend a hand in our Parent Center. He greets us daily with a smile, eager to work. It truly takes everyone doing their part to make a school successful, and Mr. Peterson does his part every day. We thank Mr. Peterson for his excellent service to our school and the children.",
